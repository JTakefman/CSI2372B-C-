/* Rule 3/5 in C++11:
refers to the principles of managing resources (like dynamic memory, file handles, or network connections) in classes that define their own custom destructors, copy constructors, or assignment operators
-  If a class defines any one of the following three functions, it should define all three: 1- copy constructor, 2- destructor, 3- Copy Assignment Operator.

The Rule of 5 extends the Rule of 3 to handle move resources rather than duplicating them, especially when dealing with large objects or temporary objects by defining:
 - Move Constructor: Transfers ownership of resources from a temporary object (r-value) to a new object, avoiding deep copying.
 - Move Assignment Operator: Transfers resources from one existing object to another, again avoiding deep copying.

* A move constructor "moves" resources from one object to another, rather than copying them. It was introduced in C++11 to improve performance when dealing with temporary objects, especially when those objects manage dynamic memory or other resources.
* The move constructor is designed to "steal" the resources from a source object that is about to be destroyed, avoiding the need for a deep copy of the objectâ€™s data. After the move, the source object is typically left in an empty but valid state.
